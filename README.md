# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
In this project, I built an app that helps a user select their favorite mantras and affirmations that are provided by the Self Care Center. It solves the problem of a user not remembering which ones were their favorites. They can click the heart button that will store the ones that they like the best.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <>
(What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Open up the terminal and paste the SSH code after typing git clone in the terminal. Next enter the repesitory with the cd command. Then type code . and the code will come up in the text editer. Then in the terminal type open index.html and the application will open in the browser.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)


### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We are in week three. I'd say this project took fifteen to twenty hours.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
Just me.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The goal was to get comfortable writing JS, CSS and HTML and get experience using them to build an app.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
I figured out how to use the event.target method so that the user can tell the computer exactly what they want to keep or delete. Another win was seeing how my HTML formatting was a huge helper because of it's flexability I was able to make my commands in java script much more specific by pulling classes and id's one by one.
